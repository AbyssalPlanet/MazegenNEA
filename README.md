# MazegenNEA

Welcome to MazegenNEA, my A-Level Computer Science NEA project (2024).

The application is designed for desktop use and built with Qt Creator, featuring an interactive interface that allows users to visualize and algorithmically solve mazes.

Algorithms implemented:
1. Randomised Depth-First Search (DFS)
2. Prim's Algorithm
3. Loop-Erased Random Walk (LERW)
